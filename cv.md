# About Me

Hi, my name is Mike and i am 35 years old. I am the founder and technical director of a programming school for kids - kidkod.ru, as well a software developer who used python (django at most) for backend, and html/css/js for frontend. My hobbies is pomodoro learning and running.

Right now i want to find a regular programmer job, because my current project is outsourced and worked well without me.
